## 🙋🏻‍♀️ What is OpenGL
As we can see from the name, it's Open Graphics Library.

### 🙋 Then what is Graphics Library?
- a library providing graphics rendering APIs, usually used for 2D and 3D graphics.
#### - they are used in various fields, like ..
  - Video Games
  - Simulation and Virtual Reality (VR) / Augmented Reality (AR)
  - Film and Animation (CGI)
  - Medical Imaging and Visualization
  - Computer-Aided Design (CAD)
  - Scientific Visualization
  - 3D Modeling and Animation Software
  - Web Development (WebGL)
  - Machine Learning and AI (Data Visualization)
  - Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
  - Robotics and Autonomous Systems
  - Advertising and Marketing (Interactive Media)
  - Social Media and Content Creation
  - Art and Creative Industries ...
  - and so on
#### - and the examples for Graphics Library are as following:
  - WebGL, DirectX, Vulkan, Metal, OpenGL ES, OpenCL
  - (TBU for short descriptions of each of them)

### 🙋🏻‍♀️ Then What's the identifiable characteristics of OpenGL from others?
- it's a cross-platform.
- real-time rendering
- high-level hardware abstraction
- high level + fully programmable Shading Pipeline

## 🙋 Then How can we use OpenGL
### Environment
- since it's cross-platform, we can use it in Linux, MacOS and Windows.
### Installation
- the following commands are for installing OpenGL in Linux
  ```
  sudo apt-get update

  sudo apt install g++
  sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev freeglut3
  sudo apt-get install binutils-gold
  ```
